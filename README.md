# 1. Credit Scoring Classification

This folder contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, and Machine Learning Model within one Jupyter Notebook file.

# 2. Credit Scoring App

This folder is a development of folder (1) but uses different data. It contains a simulation App for users to calculate their Credit Score.

The purpose of this App is to showcase how a Credit Score Evaluation works in a fictional bank and the evaluation uses a machine-learning model.

This simple application shows how companies can evaluate a person's credit score, you can see the application directly [here](https://credit-scoring-application.streamlit.app)
